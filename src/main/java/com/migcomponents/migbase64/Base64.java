/**
 * A very fast and memory efficient class to encode and decode to and from BASE64 in full accordance
 * with RFC 2045.<br><br>
 * On Windows XP sp1 with 1.4.2_04 and later ;), this encoder and decoder is about 10 times faster
 * on small arrays (10 - 1000 bytes) and 2-3 times as fast on larger arrays (10000 - 1000000 bytes)
 * compared to <code>sun.misc.Encoder()/Decoder()</code>.<br><br>
 *
 * On byte arrays the encoder is about 20% faster than Jakarta Commons Base64 Codec for encode and
 * about 50% faster for decoding large arrays. This implementation is about twice as fast on very small
 * arrays (less than 30 bytes). If source/destination is a <code>String</code> this
 * version is about three times as fast due to the fact that the Commons Codec result has to be recoded
 * to a <code>String</code> from <code>byte[]</code>, which is very expensive.<br><br>
 *
 * This encode/decode algorithm doesn't create any temporary arrays as many other codecs do, it only
 * allocates the resulting array. This produces less garbage and it is possible to handle arrays twice
 * as large as algorithms that create a temporary array. (E.g. Jakarta Commons Codec). It is unknown
 * whether Sun's <code>sun.misc.Encoder()/Decoder()</code> produce temporary arrays but since performance
 * is quite low it probably does.<br><br>
 *
 * The encoder produces the same output as the Sun one except that the Sun's encoder appends
 * a trailing line separator if the last character isn't a pad. Unclear why but it only adds to the
 * length and is probably a side effect. Both are in conformance with RFC 2045 though.<br>
 * Commons codec seem to always att a trailing line separator.<br><br>
 *
 * <b>Note!</b>
 * The encode/decode method pairs (types) come in three versions with the <b>exact</b> same algorithm and
 * thus a lot of code redundancy. This is to not create any temporary arrays for transcoding to/from different
 * format types. The methods not used can simply be commented out.<br><br>
 *
 * There is also a "fast" version of all decode methods that works the same way as the normal ones, but
 * har a few demands on the decoded input. Normally though, these fast verions should be used if the source if
 * the input is known and it hasn't bee tampered with.<br><br>
 *
 * If you find the code useful or you find a bug, please send me a note at base64 @ miginfocom . com.
